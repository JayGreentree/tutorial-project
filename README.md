Meant for demonstration only; CSS should not be used in production.

Grab the `templates/` folder and `web/styles.css`.

## Customizing Styles

0. Make sure youâ€™ve installed `npm` on your system: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Edit `src/styles.css` as needed.
1. Run `npm run prod`, which will output to `web/styles.css`.
